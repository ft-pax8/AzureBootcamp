# Azure Site Recovery for Migration  




## Before you Begin

Your Azure subscription is limited in the amount of cores that you can provision.  Ensure that you have deleted the VMs from the previous labs before completing this lab. 


## Lab Concepts

In this lab you will create a VM in Azure to simulate a source VM running in either VMware or Hyper-V on the ground.  We will then replicate (aka migrate) the VM to Azure using ASR (Azure Site Recovery).

Please note that using this approach represents `the fastest way` to migrate a VM to Azure and should not be seen as the usual, customary amount of time it takes to perform a migration to Azure.  The proper way to migrate VMs is using Azure Migrate, which leverages DMA and ASR as part of the project workflow to migrate the VMs.  It also includes the pre-assessments, which are used for sizing recommendations, and helps identify any migration issues you may encounter before you migrate the source VM.  Due to time and subscription limits, we are instead demonstrating the migration capabilities using ASR directly.  Azure Migrate performs these steps on your behalf, through an project workflow, but it too uses the same ASR steps performed here.  By using ASR directly, you not only understand the migration process better, but you also get the benefit of learning how to use ASR for BC/DR protection of VMs.

If you would like to go through a migration using Azure Migrate, we offer a comprehensive [Azure Migrate Lab available on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Line-of-business-application-migration/tree/master/Hands-on%20lab).  **Note** that it requires 14-18 available cores to complete and a Free Azure Subscription does not offer enough available quota to complete this lab.  This lab can only be completed in a PAYG, CSP, EA subscription.


After completing this lab, you should understand how to:
1. How to use ASR to setup replica (Disaster Recovery) of a VM in another region
2. Test a failover (migration), from one region to another 
3. Migrate (failover) a VM from one region (or on-premises) to another 


## Exercise 1 - Create an IIS VM with PowerShell

In this task you use the Azure CLI to create an Azure Virtual Machine running Windows Server 2016, and install IIS.

1. Open an Azure CLI window by browsing to [Azure Shell](https://shell.azure.com).
2. Login using your Microsoft Account.
3. If prompted, select the default AAD directory.
4. If a Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell prompt appears after logon, select Bash as the working CLI. If it does not appear, you can select PowerShell from the dropdown in the upper-left corner once a CLI prompt is presented to you. Note that you may need to provision a new CLI storage account to save your settings.
5. At the CLI prompt, let's create a new resource group to hold your IIS VM. Create the resource group by typing in the following command:
`az group create --name Migration --location eastus`
6. Create the VM by typing in the following command:

    `az vm create --resource-group Migration --name IIS --location eastus --image win2016datacenter
 --admin-username goose
 --admin-password Complex.Password`
7. Once the VM is created, let's open port 80 so we can access the VM's website from the internet. Run the follwing command:

    `az vm open-port --port 80 --resource-group Migration --name IIS`
8. Now let's install IIS using a Custom Script Extension. **Please make sure you are running the CLI in Bash.  The script will error if you use PowerShell.** Run the following command:

    `az vm extension set --publisher Microsoft.Compute --version 1.8 --name CustomScriptExtension --vm-name IIS --resource-group Migration
 --settings '{"commandToExecute":"powershell.exe Install-WindowsFeature -Name Web-Server"}'`
9. Get the public IP of IIS by running the following command:

    `az network public-ip show --resource-group Migration --name IISPublicIP`
10. Open a browser on your laptop and browse to the public IP of the VM you just created with IIS.  You should be taken to the default IIS website that is running on your new VM.

## Exercise 2 - Create target network resource

We could have ASR automatically create the target network resources (i.e. Virtual networks and subnets) but in a more realistic scenario you'd want to pre-create these resources and place your migrated VMs in specific networks.

1. Click on Virtual networks then **+Add**
2. Enter or select the following information, accept the defaults for the remaining settings, and then select **Create**:
    * Name: **MigrationvNet**
    * Address Space: **10.10.0.0/16**
    * Resource Group: *Create New* **MigrationvNets**
    * Location: **Central US**
    * Subnet Name: **migsub**
    * Subnet address range: **10.10.10.0/24**

## Exercise 3 - Create a Recovery Services vault

This task is the normal starting point for a typical lift and shift migration as you would normally have a robust source environment to migrate.

1. Click **+Create a resource > IT & Management Tools > Backup and Site Recovery** and enter **MyVault** as the Name and **ASRMigration** as the Resource Group.  Choose **Central US** as the location. Click **Review + Create** and then **Create**.

## Exercise 4 - Select a replication goal

1. Once the vault deployment has succeeded, click on **Go to Resource** or in the search bar type in **MyVault** and select it.
2. In the **Getting Started** Menu, click **Site Recovery** > **Prepare Infrastructure**.
3. In **Protection goal**, set the following:
    * Where are your machines located?: **Azure**
    * Where do you want to replicate your machines to? **To Azure**
    * Click **OK**, and then **OK** again on the **Prepare Infrastructure** tab.

## Exercise 5 - Enable replication

1. In the Azure portal, click **Virtual machines**, and select the **IIS**.
2. Under **Operations**, click **Disaster recovery**.
3. In **Configure disaster recovery** > **Target region** select the target region to which you'll replicate and where you create the network resources in Task 2, which should be the Central US. Click **Next: Advanced settings**.
4. Under Advanced settings, set the following Target resources:  
    * VM resource group: **MigrationvNets**
    * Virtual network: **MigrationvNet**
    * Availability: **Availability set**
    * Click **Next: Review + Start Replication**.
5. Review the settings and click **Start replication**. This starts a job to enable replication (aka migration) for the VM.
6. You may notice that Vaildating and Creating target resources takes a few moments to process.  The fabric is ensuring that resources in your target region can be created and there’s no conflicts nor capacity issues.

## Exercise 6 - Track Replication

1. Once Azure has built the core components replication will begin.  On the alert button (the bell) click on **Enabling replication for 1 vm(s)**.  You may need to wait a couple mins for it to appear.
2. Notice the steps as they occur in real time.  The longest step in the process is going to be **Enable replication** - again, wait a minute or two for it to show up if you don't immediately see it.  Select that item and observe the series of steps taking place. IR, or Initial Replication, the time it takes the VM to be copied from source to target.  Notice the Status of IR.  
3. Since it may take 30 minutes to replicate the VM, now may be an appropriate time to take a break or come back to the lab at a later time.
4. You can check percentage complete of replication by **Virtual Machines > IIS > Operations > Disaster Recovery**.  You may notice status sits at 0% synchronized for some time and then report upwards of 87% complete on next refresh.

## Exercise 7 - Run a Test Failover

A test failover executes a failover but does not make the secondary or migrated VM active.  A drill validates your replication strategy without data loss or downtime and doesn't affect your production environment.

1. In the Azure Portal navigate to Virtual machines, then IIS, then Disaster Recovery.  Click the **Test Failover** icon.
2. In Test Failover, select **Latest (lowest RPO)** as the recovery point to use for the failover.  Note the following:
    * **Latest (lowest RPO):** Fails the VM over with the current state of the VM but requires some processing time.
    * **Latest processed (low RTO):** Fails the VM over to the latest recovery point that was processed by the Site Recovery service. The time stamp is shown. With this option, no time is spent processing data, so it provides a low RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
    * **Latest app-consistent:** This option fails over all VMs to the latest app-consistent recovery point. The time stamp is shown.
    * **Custom:** Use this option to fail over to a specific recovery point. This option is useful for performing a test failover.
3. Select the target Azure virtual network to which Azure VMs in the secondary region will be connected after the failover occurs, which in this lab is **MigrationvNet**.  
4. To start the failover, click **OK**. Track progress by selecting the alert in the Notifications window.
5. After the failover finishes (Start the virtual machine task is successful), the replica Azure VM appears in the Azure portal under Virtual Machines. Make sure that the VM is running, sized appropriately, and connected to the appropriate network. Note that the VM does not have a Public IP address.
6. To delete the VMs that were created during the test failover, select **IIS** from **Virtual Machines**, select **Disaster recovery** under  **Operations**, and then choose **Cleanup test failover** (click the link at the top, not the text next to 'status'). In Notes, record and save any observations associated with the test failover. Click the box for **Testing is complete** and click **Ok**.
If you don’t delete the failover VM, the VM will continue to run and increase your Azure consumption.

## Exercise 8 - Switch over to the migrated VM

 Once you have validated the migrated VM by performing a test failover, your next step would be to switch over to the migrated VM.  In this lab you will complete the migration.

 1. Once **Test Failover** is complete, click on **Failover**.
 2. Under **Recovery Point** enure that **(low RTO)** is selected and click **OK**. Note the checkbox to shut down the source VM before failover (migration).
 Under alerts click the link for **Starting failover** and monitor the failover (migration).
 3. Once failover is complete, click on **Virtual Machines** in the Azure Portal and notice that you have two IIS VMs; one stopped (deallocated) in the East US and then another VM in the Central US that's running.

## Exercise 9 - Make your migrated VM accessible

 When you migrate a VM, a public IP address is not added by default and the Virtual Network does not have any Network Security Group rules.  We need to add both of these to make the VM accessible to the internet and to protect it.

 For real production migrations Microsoft recommends that you add these steps to what is called a recovery plan so that they are automatically built and added as the VM is migrated.  This can be a done as a manual process or automated using Azure Automation.  You will not do this in this lab, but please review the following articles for detailed steps on how to add this to your Site Recovery Plan, so you are familiar with the process for when you do this for your customers.
